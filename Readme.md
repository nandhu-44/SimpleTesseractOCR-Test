# Test-OCR Project

This project uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images from the [`inputs`](/inputs) directory. It uses the Tesseract OCR engine and the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to open images and extract text. The extracted text is then saved to a file in the `outputs` directory.
