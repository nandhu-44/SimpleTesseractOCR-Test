# Test-OCR Project

This project uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from images from the [`inputs`](/inputs) directory. It uses the Tesseract OCR engine and the Python Imaging Library (PIL)/ OpenCV  to open images and extract text. The extracted text is then saved to a file in the `outputs` directory.

> _This code does not produce perfect results, but it is a good starting point for further development. The code can be improved by using different OCR engines, pre-processing images, and tuning the OCR engine parameters._
